Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 4, 350°F (180°C).\n\n2. Begin by making the salsa: first tip the tomatoes into a sieve over a bowl to let the excess liquid drain away.\n\n3. Next remove the stalk from the chili, cut it in half, chop the flesh very finely and place it in a bowl. \n4. Then add half the chopped onion, the drained tomatoes, chopped coriander leaves and lime juice, and season well with salt and pepper. Now give everything a thorough mixing. \n\n5. Meanwhile, mix the 2 cheeses together in a bowl. \n6. Place one tortilla on a flat surface and spread a tablespoon of salsa over it, but not quite to the edges, sprinkle over a heaped tablespoon of the cheese mixture, then follow this with a tablespoon of the crème fraîche.\n8. Then roll the tortilla up and place it in the baking dish with the sealed-side down. Repeat this with the others, then spread the remaining crème fraîche on top of the tortillas in the dish and sprinkle the rest of the salsa over the top, followed by the remaining cheeses and red onion.\n9. Now place the dish on a high shelf of the oven for 15-20 minutes, garnish with the extra coriander and serve absolutely immediately – if you keep them waiting they can become a bit soggy.",

Italian seasoning (if we have none, mix together some basil, oregano, rosemary, and thyme)\n200g pasta shells (conchiglie)\n5 cloves garlic, peeled (2 pressed/minced)\n1 medium butternut squash, diced into 1.5cm cubes\n24g (3 Tbsp.) plain flour\n250ml vegetable stock\n250ml low-fat milk\n12 leaves (1 Tbsp.) chopped fresh sage (or 0.7g (1 tsp.) dried sage)\n115g freshly-grated Parmesan cheese\n4.5g salt\n1g black pepper\n30ml olive oil\n~100g Mozzarella, shredded\n\nMETHOD\n1. Preheat oven to 200°C.\n2. In a small bowl, stir together the Panko, melted butter, Italian seasoning and 1.5g (1/4 tsp.) salt until combined.  Set aside.\n3. Peel, de-seed and dice the butternut squash into 1.5cm cubes, peel 3 garlic cloves and place both into a large mixing bowl with some olive oil until evenly coated.\n4. Remove the 3 garlic cloves from the bowl, and wrap them in some tinfoil to form a pouch.\n5. Spread the butternut squash out on a baking tray (you can line it with foil or baking paper if you wish) and season generously with a few pinches of salt and pepper.  \n6. Put the garlic clove pouch (from step 4) on the baking tray next to the butternut squash. \n7. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the butternut squash mash easily with a fork and the garlic is soft and fragrant.\n8. In the meantime, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook al dente (or slightly undercooked) according to package instructions. Drain.\n9. Make the Alfredo sauce by heating some olive oil in a large frying over medium-high heat. Make 250ml vegetable stock in a jug.\n10. Mince or press 2 garlic cloves to the pan and sauté for one minute, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. \n11. Sprinkle the pan with 24g (3 Tbsp) of flour, and stir to combine. Sauté for an additional minute to cook the flour, stirring occasionally.\n12. Add the vegetable stock to the frying pan whisking to combine until smooth. \n13. Whisk in 250ml milk and a teaspoon of dried sage, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Allow to cook for another minute until slightly thickened.\n14. Grate 115g Parmesan cheese and add to frying pan. Season with salt and pepper and stir until the cheese melted.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until ready to use.\n15. Once cooked, put both the butternut squash and garlic back into the large mixing bowl along with ~250ml of the sauce and mash together until smooth.\n16. In a medium baking dish (I use the glass dish), spread out ~125ml of the remaining sauce in a layer. Place the pasta shells in the dish in an even layer (if you’re feeling patient you can stuff them with the butternut filling), then top with the butternut filling. \n17. Spoon the remaining alfredo sauce evenly on top.  (Optional: if using the mozzarella, sprinkle it on top of the alfredo sauce.)  Then sprinkle the Panko mixture evenly over the top of everything.\n18. Bake uncovered for 15 minutes, or until the Panko mixture is crispy and starts to turn slightly golden.  Remove and serve immediately.",

Add to the pan gradually, stirring to prevent lumps.\n4. Stir in the soy sauce and honey. Bring to the boil then simmer for 10-15mins to reduce until thickened. If you want a smoother sauce you can blitz it in a blender.\n5. Whilst the sauce is simmering, make the rice according to the packet instructions. Then make the veggies.\n\nVegetables method:\n\n1. Slice the pumpkin/butternut squash into 1cm circles/crescent moon shapes\n2. Put breadcrumbs, flour and eggs into 3 separate bowls. Dip all the veg in the flour, followed by the eggs and then the breadcrumbs to coat evenly.\n3. Put in 180°C oven for 20mins\n4. Heat oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Shallow fry vegetables in batches for 1-2mins per side, scooping out when golden and draining on kitchen roll.\n\nFinally pour the katsu sauce over the veg and serve with rice.",

    "description": "Ingredients\n100g (3.5oz) dry wide rice noodles\n4 tablespoons oil\n1 tablespoon pickled radish\n1 egg\n2 tablespoons crushed peanuts, halved\n1/3 cup white tofu, cut into 1″ x 1/3″ x 1/3″ sticks\n1/4 cup :garlic chives:, cut into 2″ long pieces\n1/2 cup bean sprouts, halved\n1 1/8 teaspoons chili powder (leave 1 teaspoon for garnish)\n1/8 – 1/2 cup water, just in case\n1 teaspoon white sugar, for garnish\n1 lime piece, for garnish\nSauce\n1 tablespoon white soy sauce\n1 tablespoon palm sugar\n1 tablespoon tamarind paste (1/8 c tamarind pulp + 1/8 c water)\nDirections\nSoak the rice noodles in room temperature water for 30-45 minutes before you cook. Do not soak in hot water or your noodles will get sticky. You want them to be soft enough to bend, but still firm. When finished soaking, drain, rinse, and set aside.\nPrepare the tamarind paste by squishing 1/8 cup tamarind pulp with 1/8 cup water in a small bowl with your fingers. Take out all the tamarind veins and seeds, and squish the fruit until the water turns into a thickish paste. Strain the pulp with a strainer and set aside.\nPrepare the sauce by adding 1 tablespoon of that tamarind paste you just made with the soy sauce \u0026 palm sugar in a small bowl. If your palm sugar is rock hard and doesn’t dissolve, you can cut into small bits and microwave the mixture for 10 seconds or so. That should soften the sugar enough to dissolve.\nFry the tofu in hot oil until medium brown on each side. Remove from oil and set aside.\nAdd more oil to the pan, if necessary. Wait until the oil is hot, and ‘dancing’ around (look at the surface — is the oil moving?) Add the pickled radish and fry for a few seconds to get the flavor out.\nAdd your noodles and stir. You may want to add about 1/8-1/4 cup water too, depending on how hot your wok is. When the noodles soften a bit, add the sauce and the 1/8 teaspoon of the chili powder (leave the rest for garnish). Mix well — but be careful not to make a noodle mush. Try to keep the noodles separated as much as possible, covering the entire bottom of the pan. Spread them out.\nCook until the noodles are soft — it may take a minute or two. Taste to be sure they are done. If they get too dry, you may need to add a bit more water.\nWhen the noodles are done, push them to the side to create room for the egg. Crack the egg into the space and scramble it with your spatula and cover the bottom of the pan. Throw the noodles on top of the egg.\nAdd the chives, 1/2 of the peanuts and 1/2 bean sprouts. Mix well, and remove to a plate. You may get egg bits stuck to the pan. Scrape them off and eat them. I call these ‘wok crispies’. You actually want to try to get them.\nGarnish with the rest of the sprouts on top, a slice of lime, and a pile each of the white sugar, the rest of the peanuts and the rest of the chili powder. You can also garnish with a few uncut garlic chives and 1/4 small banana flower too.\nNote:\nThis recipe is for one large portion of Pad Thai. If you're making more than one portion, cook them one at a time in the pan, instead of mixing all at once. If you cook too much at a time, you'll get tasteless noodle mush. Also, this dish has a very short cooking time. Make sure to measure and line up all your ingredients within arm's reach before starting to cook.",

If you would rather juice the ingredients to make it even smoother, go right ahead! I like to keep all the fiber and nutrients in but juicing the ingredients is just as good.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n### NOTES\nIf you can't find fresh turmeric and need to use the powdered turmeric, use about 1/2-1 tablespoon and adjust to your liking.",

When this is hot, ladle in enough of your batter to just cover the base of the pan.\n3.

Fold half the pancake over, pour another teaspoon or so of oil around the edge of the pancake and cover with an upturned metal bowl or a lid and cook for about 3-4 minutes, until the ingredients start to soften and the underneath of the crepe has started to turn golden and darker brown in spots.\n4. While the pancake is cooking, mix together all the ingredients for the Nuoc Cham dipping sauce (4 tablespoons water, sugar, lime juice, fish sauce, chillies, garlic, flavourless oil) and whisk till the sugar dissolves. Tear the leaves from the lettuce leaving them as large as possible.\n5.
